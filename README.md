### General Purpose Mode

In general purpose mode, EVE will engage in a conversation with you using logical reasoning. You can ask EVE any question or pose any problem, and she will try to respond with a logical answer. To exit general purpose mode at any time, simply type "exit" or "quit".

### Erotic Mode

In erotic mode, EVE will engage in a more intimate conversation with you. You can talk to EVE about anything related to sexuality and she will respond with understanding and empathy. To exit erotic mode at any time, simply type "exit" or "quit".
